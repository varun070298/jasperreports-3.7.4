<b>CSV Data Sources</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Report filling is one of the basic steps during the report generation. After the report compilation, 
significant report data are read from the report data source, or calculated from report expressions, 
and the generated <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/JasperReport.html">JasperReport</api> object 
is filled section by section. 
<br/>
Data sources are very useful when data come as a set of structured records, either extracted from a 
relational database, or loaded from specific files. In order to become more familiar with data source 
objects please consult the <a href="../datasources.html#datasources">Data Sources</a> section.
<br/>
Sometimes data that users need to fill the report with is found in plain text files, in a 
certain format, such as the popular CSV (comma-separated value).
<br/>
JasperReports provides an implementation for such a data source, by wrapping the CSV 
data from a text file into a <api href="net/sf/jasperreports/engine/data/JRCsvDataSource.html">JRCsvDataSource</api>. 
The CSV data source usually needs to read a file from disk, or at least from an input stream. 
<br/>
CSV is a file format with very few formatting rules: data rows are separated by a record 
delimiter (text sequence) and fields inside each row are separated by a field delimiter 
(character). Fields containing delimiter characters can be placed inside quotes. If fields 
contain quotes themselves, these are duplicated (for example, <code>"John ""Doe"""</code> will be 
displayed as <code>John "Doe"</code>).
<br/>
The most common delimiters for CSV files are:
<ul>
<li>comma (<code>,</code>) - as field delimiter</li>
<li>newline (<code>\n</code>) - as record delimiter</li>
</ul>
Users can override these default values by calling <code>setFieldDelimiter(char)</code> and 
<code>setRecordDelimiter(String)</code> of the <code>JRCsvDataSource</code> class. 
<br/>
There are two categories of CSV files:
<ol>
<li>files with a header record containing column names, all the other records containing field values;</li>
<li>files without a header record; all records contain only field values. This is the default category.</li>
</ol>
For the files in the first category, column names are read from the first row in the CSV file. 
But the engine should be informed that the input file belongs to the 
first category. This can be done by calling the <code>setUseFirstRowAsHeader(true)</code> method of the <code>JRCsvDataSource</code>.
<br/>
If files belong to the second category (default), column names have to be provided separately, taking into account that 
the column names order should be the same as the column order in a data record. If this is not possible, 
the default naming convention is to use the <code>COLUMN_</code> prefix followed by the zero-based column index.
<br/>
For instance, if is known that a particular column is the third column in the record 
(index=2), then one could name the corresponding field "COLUMN_2" and use the 
column data without problems.
<br/> 
Another problem when working with CSV files is related to data types. Handling data types 
for fields in CSV data sources is special since the CSV file format 
does not provide such information. This kind of matter is solved by trying to match each field in 
the data source to its corresponding report field type. For number and date/time fields, 
converting text values to <code>java.lang.Number</code> and <code>java.util.Date</code> values respectively 
requires parsing using format objects. This is controlled by specifying the date and 
number format objects to be used with the <code>JRCsvDataSource</code> instance by calling its 
<code>setDateFormat(DateFormat)</code> and <code>setNumberFormat(NumberFormat)</code> methods 
before passing it to the report-filling process.
<br/>

<b>CSV Data Source Example</b>
<br/>
<br/>
In our example data records are stored in the /data/CsvDataSource.txt file. Although the file extension is <code>.txt</code>, 
it contains structured data according to the CSV rules:
<pre><![CDATA[
  "Dallas",47,"Janet Fuller","445 Upland Pl.","Trial"
  "Lyon",38,"Andrew Heiniger","347 College Av.","Active"
  "Dallas",43,"Susanne Smith","2 Upland Pl.","Active"

  "Oslo",45,"Janet May","396 Seventh Av.","Active"
  "Paris",18,"Sylvia Fuller","158 - 20th Ave.","Trial"
  "San Francisco",48,"Robert White","549 Seventh Av.","Active"

]]></pre>
The file has no header row with column names. Column names are set independently, as shown in the 
<code>getDataSource()</code> method in the /src/CsvDataSourceApp.java file: 
<pre><![CDATA[
  private static JRCsvDataSource getDataSource() throws JRException
  {
    String[] columnNames = new String[]{"city", "id", "name", "address", "state"};
    JRCsvDataSource ds = new JRCsvDataSource(JRLoader.getLocationInputStream("data/CsvDataSource.txt"));
    ds.setRecordDelimiter("\r\n");
    ds.setColumnNames(columnNames);
    return ds;
  }
]]></pre>
The five column names are: <code>city</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>address</code> and <code>state</code>, 
in this particular order. Field names are identical to the column names defined here.
<br/>
The <code>JRCsvDataSource</code> object prepared above is passed to the engine at fill time (see again the /src/CsvDataSourceApp.java file):
<pre><![CDATA[
  public void fill() throws JRException
  {
    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
    //Preparing parameters
    Map parameters = new HashMap();
    parameters.put("ReportTitle", "Address Report");
    parameters.put("DataFile", "CsvDataSource.txt - CSV data source");
    Set states = new HashSet();
    states.add("Active");
    states.add("Trial");
    parameters.put("IncludedStates", states);

    JasperFillManager.fillReportToFile("build/reports/CsvDataSourceReport.jasper", parameters, getDataSource());
    System.err.println("Filling time : " + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start));
  }
]]></pre>
The <code>IncludedStates</code> parameter defined above is used for data filtering. Only records with <code>Active</code> 
or <code>Trial</code> states will be taken into account:
<br/>
<br/>
<code>
&#160;&#160;&lt;parameter name="IncludedStates" class="java.util.Set"/&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
&#160;&#160;...
<br/>
<br/>
&#160;&#160;&lt;filterExpression&gt;&lt;![CDATA[$P{IncludedStates}.contains($F{state}) ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE]]&gt;&lt;/filterExpression&gt;
</code>
<br/>
<br/>
In order to figure out more on CSV data sources, just test this sample by running from the command line the <code>ant test view</code> command. 
It will generate all supported document types containing the sample report in the /build/reports directory, and then the report will be open with JasperReports internal viewer.
